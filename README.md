# Optimize MQTT performance with Diffusion®

MQTT is a publish-subscribe messaging protocol commonly used to connect Internet of Things (IoT) applications. A wide range of IoT devices can now connect directly to Diffusion, send and receive data, interact with other Diffusion clients, and benefit from Diffusion’s event data processing features and rich security framework. MQTT can also be used as a lightweight alternative to the Diffusion SDK for simple publish-subscribe use cases.

# Diffusion Real-Time Event Stream integration with MQTT
Introduction to Diffusion Real-Time Event Stream through a simple application using Diffusion and MQTT.js.  In this tutorial we will create an MQTT client to publish Star Wars dialogs in real-time and consume them through MQTT subscriber as well as Diffusion subscriber.  The goal is to show how easy it is to consume real-time data from MQTT into Diffusion with no-code required as well as how much efficiency you can add to your solution by using Diffusion. Reduce latency and bandwidth and increase throughput with our Delta Data Technology.

# The Code Example
See how quickly Diffusion consumes MQTT event data and displays its values compare with a pure MQTT solution. Learn how much data you can save when using our Delta Data Technology and how fast your consumers will get that data.

We are currently working on javascript implementation of the described use case, using MQTT.js  and Diffusion.

Start getting familiar with Diffusion by signing up to our free Cloud solution or download our on-premise version and run it in your local environment.
